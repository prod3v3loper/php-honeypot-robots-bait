# PHP üçØ HoneyPot Robots Bait

The goal is to confuse or distract the hacker.
However, there are differences, automated or manual.

### Manual

In order to code an attack manually, one would also have to debug. Which means that it will not be enough on your test system.

### Automatic

A finished tool, however, which is already more advanced, will not need this. Because these are programmed specifically for systems and run automatically. But both can be misled.

# Bait

We issue a `robots.txt` if it doesn't exist. If there is one, we write the following in it.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin-login.php
```

> **Malicious**
>
> If the bot or a hacker looks up the `robots.txt` and calls up the unauthorized pages, it is a sign of malicious intent.

In this case the `robots.txt` serves as a bait in which we display a file with the important name `admin-login.php`, which is our honeypot.

# Confuse

In our honepot file, so in this example the `admin-login.php` contains the following information:

> **Choose**
>
> The name for the file `admin-login` is freely chosen here and can be named as desired.

Our `logger.php` is located above the HTML, which writes the data to our `honeypot.log` file.
And includes our two classes `class.HoneyPot.php` (Logging) and `class.Server.php` (Data)

```php
<?php require_once 'logger.php'; ?>
```

We show the bot or hacker that it landed on a non-existent page, so we're just faking it and log him in our honeypot.

```html
<html>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    window["_gaUserPrefs"] = {
      ioo: function () {
        return true;
      },
    };
  </script>
  <head>
    <title>404 Not Found</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Not Found</h1>
    <p>The requested URL was not found on this server.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Refuse

Once everything has been implemented, the attacker's data is written to a file with the help of the `class.HoneyPot.php`

## Log file permissions

The rights for the file are therefore set in `class.HoneyPot.php`.

> **Important**
>
> The `honeypot.log` must not be read from the browser.

Read and write permissions for the owner, none for everyone else.

```php
chmod("/somedir/somefile", 0600)
```

## Example log

The file called `honeypot.log` contains all the attackers

```log
[15.10.2021 - 18:14:41]
IP: 127.0.0.1
AGENT: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.81 Safari/537.36
HOST: 127.0.0.1
```

# Checking

- [x] Add `classes` folder to project root
- [x] Created or edited `robots.txt` is in project root
- [x] Add `admin-login.php` and `logger.php` in project root

> **Information**
>
> If mod_rewrite is activated, it may not work because all inquiries, e.g. for CMS systems, are forwarded to the index via htaccess.
>
> And that's a good thing because the other pages or sub-folders should not be accessible.
>
> But it is mostly so that you can sometimes call it via the browser, because this was not prevented.

# Conclusion

This is a method to possibly receive information about an attack.
There are of course many other options that I will present here.
